Mini Counter: Your perfect companion to aid you with keeping count of just about anything!
It is literally as simple as glancing at your wrist to see the count of the thing you are currently keeping track of without the need for a phone.

Why use Mini Counter:
- You are collecting apples and you need to keep an eye on what the total mass is
- You are playing a board game with your friends and you are forgetting your game score
- You want to know how many times your cat intimidated you with the staring contest

## Setup
[CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org) are being used as a dependency management.
If you haven't done so, first, you will need to [install CocoaPods](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html).

Afterwards, execute
```pod install```
terminal command in the root directory of the project. If successful, it will fetch all necessary dependencies and the project will be ready to be build within Xcode.
